A former Royal Marine who has decided to go for a complete career change by learning to code over 16 weeks at Makers Academy. A reliable and adaptable professional with an eye for attention to detail. Excellent organisational, interpersonal and communication skills.

I'm looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role in the South West of England where I can continue to learn something new every day, in an organisation that loves developing both great software and it's people.


## <a name ="skills">Key Skills

#### I Can Code

More info here. Languages, specific projects.

#### I Communicate well

Throughout the Makers Academy course I was working in agile teams, learning to collaborate, deliver to tight deadlines, resolve conflicts, and efficiently communicate with other members of my cohort. The course used pair-programming as the central working method between students. My communication skills were actively developed and challenged every day through these methods.
Whilst in the Royal Marines I often had to give officers and civilians on-water safety briefs. I have experience working in small, tight-knit teams where communication between ourselves and outside agencies was often key to mission success.

#### I am Adaptable

In the Royal Marines my job role and location changed roughly every 2 years. Adaptability was part and parcel of my life during my time in the forces from learning my new job roles to developing new working relationships with colleagues. When I decided to change my career and enrol in Makers Academy, I had very little coding knowledge, and now I am able to....stuff here!

#### I am Organised

My military training has a lot to do with this. I like to know where everything is; from my socks to the files on my computer. During the Makers Academy course I had to work to tight deadlines. I was constantly working to deadlines in my role as a boat coxswain in the Royal Marines.
